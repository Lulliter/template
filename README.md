## Quarto Extensions

To add extensions to your Quarto website, you can use the `quarto add` command. Here are some examples of how to add popular extensions:

```bash
quarto add quarto-ext/fontawesome
quarto add quarto-ext/leaflet
quarto add quarto-ext/mermaid
quarto add quarto-ext/openai
```


## Zotero

For `*.bib` files collections to be exported (AND KEPT UPDATED) from Zotero, I need to install the plogin *Better BibTeX* for Zotero (find instrucitions) which will offer the "keep updated" option when exporting collections.
